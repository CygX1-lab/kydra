# Kydra
A powerful, KDE-native package manager forked from Muon.

Kydra brings a modern, Plasma-integrated interface to Debian package management. 
Designed around clarity and speed, it gives users full control of repositories, 
updates, packages, and system components through a clean, multi-view UI.

✨ Fully KDE/Qt-based  
🐉 Multi-head architecture for fast search and parallel operations  
🔍 Powerful filtering, history, and dependency insights  
🎨 Beautiful Breeze-friendly interface  
📦 Built for Debian, Ubuntu, and derivatives  

Kydra is developed with the KDE ecosystem in mind and aims to become a 
reliable, elegant package tool for all Plasma desktops.
